# Quantum Key Distribution(Individual summer project 2025)

## Project Description:

This repo has two components, one is python scripts that contain minimum implementation of QKD protocols. Another is Jupyter NoteBook that contain same code as the python scripts and its mathematical explaination.

The repo contains QKD protocols <BB84>, <B92>, <E91>.
The Jupyter notebook will explain mathematical details

If you just want to deploy the protocols then should choose the python scripts only to clone. For mathematical depth, that would lead you to clone Jupyter NoteBook.
