# Quantum Key Distribution protocols(BB84 and E91) version 25.08

## Project Description:
  This project describes Quantum Key Distribution protocols (QKD protocols).
  The QKD protocols are used to build quantum communication that is able to detect interference of third parties and/or noise.
  Also, the project contains tester files for each protocol.

## ! How to run !
  1. Create a directory where you would like to clone this repository.
      1. It is recommended to make the directory into a virtual environment.      
      2. Open the terminal, and type
           
          `python -m venv path/to/your/dir`      
      3. Then check the directory contains the following
         * bin
         * include
         * lib
         * pyvenv.cfg
      4. Go to the directory by
     
          `cd path/to/your/dir`
      5. To activate the virtual environment, type
    
          `source bin/activate`    
  3. Clone the repository by
     
     `clone https://github.com/flytelyte/Quantum-Programming`
  5. Execute files. For example,

     `python bb84.py`
