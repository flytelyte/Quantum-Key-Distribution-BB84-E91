# Quantum Key Distribution protocols(BB84 and E91) version 25.08

## Project Description:
  This project describes Quantum Key Distribution protocols (QKD protocols).
  The QKD protocols are used to build quantum communication that is able to detect interference of third parties and/or noise.
  Also, the project contains tester files for each protocol.

## !How to run!
  1. Create a directory that you would like to clone this repository.
      1. It is recommended to make the directory into a virtual environment.
      2. Open the terminal, and type

      4. Then check the directory contains following,
         * bin
         * include
         * lib
         * pyvenv.cfg
      5. Go to the directory by
          `cd path/to/your/dir`.
      7. To activate the virtual environment, type
         `source bin/activate`.    
  3. Clone the repository by
     `clone https://github.com/flytelyte/Quantum-Programming`
